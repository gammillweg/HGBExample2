# HGBExample2
Draws the hive. (It does nothing else.)  (See issue: I am going to add zoom)

There are many files in an Android Studio project. Only those changed are uploaded.

HGBExample.zip created via Android Studio menu File->"Export to Zip File".

Repositories yet to be written (each build will build on the previous)

TBD: HGBExample3: Will translate the hive and fill chosen cells with color.

The code for all of the above exists in repository HGB:HGBExample.zip. 
But HGBExample.zip is somewhat overburdened. It is salvaged code form a game I worked on. 
The examples TBD above will be clean with better comments and specific to the task.

But there is one problem: I am but one person. Currently I am not devoting much 
time to this project. It may be some time before these repositories exist.
