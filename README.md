# HGBExample2
Draws the hive. Menu picks to zoom in/out and change number of cells

I added Zoom in and out -- this demonstrates change cell size

(see issue:  addRings  -- this will demonstrate changing the number of cells)

TBD: HGBExample3: Will translate the hive and fill chosen cells with color.

The code for the above exists in repository HGB:HGBExample.zip. 
But HGBExample.zip is somewhat overburdened. It is salvaged code form a game I worked on. 
The examples TBD above will be clean with better comments and specific to the task.

But there is one problem: I am but one person. Currently I am not devoting much 
time to this project. It may be some time before these repositories exist.
